    "We use a loop to access all the elements in any type of data structure. A loop is a block of code that repeats itself until it runs out of items to work with, or until a certain condition is met. In this case, our loop will run once for every item in our list. With a list that is three items long, our loop will run three times.\n",

For example, if you had a list of Gmail user names which you wanted to turn into active email addresses, your process would be:<p>    \n",
    "            \n",
    "    for every user name in this group of user names, append '@gmail.com' to each user name, and then print the result.\n",
